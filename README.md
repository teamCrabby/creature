Donke is a Tamagotchi-inspired desktop application that helps users who spend long periods in front of their computers to take breaks at intervals of their choosing. Take your breaks and Donke will thrive - skip them and her health will take a hit!

When it comes time to take a break, the application takes over the screen to encourage users to step away. Users choose how long their break should last, and if they come back early, their Donke's health will suffer. 

Users can also invite coworkers and friends into a playpen that offers a shared view of all participating Donkes. Users receive real-time updates about the status of all the Donkes in the playpen so they can encourage other users to take their breaks. 

Donke was built on Electron using React, Greensock animation library, Express, and Firebase/Firestore.
